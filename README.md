snake
=====

classic snake game made in python with the pygame library and implemented using MVC model

note: the game is designed to redraw the snake every frame. this is less efficient than taking the tail piece off and adding to the head, but i believe intuitively, adding pieces to the end and moving the snake as a whole makes more sense. also, the MVC model, which was the bigger concern of this project, would not be needed for the more efficient method
